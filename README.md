# Tangible Interfaces

Please note that actually there are two versions of this interface.

An interactive physical object for an e-learning context.

It must allow a university student to:
- check the status of the courses (maximum 6);
- access their information and services.

- The surface cannot be used for displaying texts or figures.
- The device provides the ability to change the state of its surface.
- There are audio and haptic outputs and proximity recognition system.
- There is also the possibility of an external monitor exclusively limited to the video stream of the classes.

It is required that the morphological qualities of the object suggest the actions for its manipulation.

The object must manage:
- the next online educational appointments up to 14 days;
- live teaching sessions;
- the possibility of accessing and intervening through the audio chat:
  - activating or deactivating a microphone inserted in the device;
- the expected duration of the selected session and the percentage of the session already completed;
- the number of total students and working group members participating in the session;
- new teaching materials for a given course;
- important messages from the teacher:
  - to all;
  - the working group;
  - personal;
- deadlines for the material delivery up to 14 days;
- the delivery status and the feedback availability from the teacher.
